# Deep Q Learning Framework

Simple Deep Q Learning framework. This is just a slightly modified version of
[DeepMind Acme](https://github.com/deepmind/acme)'s implementation of a deep Q
network, with a few extra utilities. I built this package in order to facilitate
the  use (and visualization) of Deep Q Learning in my projects. If you're
looking for something robust, it's probably best to use Acme.

To install *QDeep*, use the following command:

```
$ pip install qdeep
```
